The AzureVision package is an R frontend to Azure Computer Vision and Azure Custom Vision. These services let you leverage Microsoft’s Azure cloud to carry out visual recognition tasks using advanced image processing models, with minimal machine learning expertise.

The basic idea behind Custom Vision is to take a pre-built image recognition model supplied by Azure, and customise it for your needs by supplying a set of images with which to update it. All model training and prediction is done in the cloud, so you don’t need a powerful machine of your own. Similarly, since you are starting with a model that has already been trained, you don’t need a very large dataset or long training times to obtain good predictions (ideally).

An R frontend to Azure Computer Vision and Azure Custom Vision, building on the low-level functionality provided by the AzureCognitive package. These services let you leverage the cloud to carry out visual recognition tasks using advanced image processing models, without needing powerful hardware of your own.

This article walks you through how to create, train and deploy a Custom Vision model in R, using AzureVision.

All the necessary R code files are attached with this repository for AzureVision.
